Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits 
so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, 
or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. 
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. 
You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string 
and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

For example, you may serialize the following tree

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]", just the same as how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree.
 You do not necessarily need to follow this format,
  so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. 
Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
