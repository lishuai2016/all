The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, 
called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. 
After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". 
It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
Example 2:
     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1
Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
