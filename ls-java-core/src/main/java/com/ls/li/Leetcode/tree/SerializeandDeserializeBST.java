serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits 
so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, 
or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. 
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. 
You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string 
and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. 
Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
