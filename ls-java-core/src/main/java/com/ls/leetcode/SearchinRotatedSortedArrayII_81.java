/**
 https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/

 Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

 (i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).

 You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.

 Example 1:

 Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
 Output: true
 Example 2:

 Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
 Output: false
 Follow up:

 This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
 Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
