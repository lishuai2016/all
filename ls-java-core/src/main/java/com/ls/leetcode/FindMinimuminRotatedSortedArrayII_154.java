 https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/


 Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

 (i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

 Find the minimum element.

 The array may contain duplicates.

 Example 1:

 Input: [1,3,5]
 Output: 1
 Example 2:

 Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
 Output: 0
 Note:

 This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
 Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
