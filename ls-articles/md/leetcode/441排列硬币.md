You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

The idea is about quadratic equation, the formula to get the sum of arithmetic progression is
sum = (x + 1) * x / 2
so for this problem, if we know the the sum, then we can know the x = (-1 + sqrt(8 * n + 1)) / 2

(1 + X) * X = 2n
4X * X + 4 * X = 8n
(2X + 1)(2X + 1) - 1 = 8n
X = (Math.sqrt(8 * n + 1) - 1)/ 2

也可用求根公式计算
