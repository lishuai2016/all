Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each,
and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5],
which means the researcher has 5 papers in total
and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each
and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Hint:

An easy approach is to sort the array first.
What are the possible values of h-index?
A faster approach is to use extra space.

h代表“高引用次数”（high citations），一名科研人员的h指数是指他至多有h篇论文分别被引用了至少h次。
例如，某人的h指数是20，这表示他已发表的论文中，每篇被引用了至少20次的论文总共有20篇。
要确定一个人的h指数非常容易，到SCI网站，查出某个人发表的所有SCI论文，让其按被引次数从高到低排列，往下核对，
直到某篇论文的序号大于该论文被引次数，那个序号减去1就是h指数

    /**
    The idea is to see that the result can only range from 0 to the length of the array
    (because we can't have h-index greater than the total papers published).
    So we create an array "arr" which acts like a HashMap (using pigeon hole principle)
    and loop backwards from the highest element, then we find "tot"
    which is the total number of papers that has more than i citations,
    and we stop when tot>=i (total number of papers with more than i citations >= i).
    We don't need to keep going because we are trying the biggest i possible,
    we we stop and return the result.
